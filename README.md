# The Front-End Folder
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to my Front-End folder! Here you will find all of my work in different front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and JS. Each folder will be different because they will contain different webpages showcasing my skills! 

### Practice: 
[Practice README](Practice/README.md "My Practice README.md")

In this folder, you will be able to see all of my practice mini-projects. Each one has notes detailing my thoughts and methods while completing the file. 

### Project: 
[Project README](Project/README.md "My Project README.md")

In this folder, it will consist of various projects from different ideas. Each folder has a final project for highlighting and demonstrating my skills from the Practice folder.
