# Front-End Folder
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to my Front-End folder! Here you will find all of my work in different front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and JS. Each folder has a different sections of files designed to showcase my work in various areas. 

### College: 
[College README](College/README.md "My College README")

This folder contains all of my learning from various classes I have taken at Florida State University. Each sub-folder will be a class containing a language I learned. 

### Practice: 
[Practice README](Practice/README.md "My Practice README")

In this folder, you will be able to see all of my practice mini-projects. Each one has notes detailing my thoughts and methods while completing the file. 

### Project: 
[Projects README](Projects/README.md "My Projects README")

In this folder, it will consist of various projects from different ideas. Each folder has a final project for highlighting and demonstrating my skills from the Practice folder.
