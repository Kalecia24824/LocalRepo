        <div>
            <p>Welcome to the HTML Reference Page where you can any basic element you need in case of reference. Now, remember this is the basic elements not the advance elements. There are some other sites that have a ist of elements as a reference. Anyways, let's get started!</p>
        </div> <br>

        <div> <!--Paragraph-->
            <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
            <p>To make a paragraph like the one above, you can use the p or the paragraph element. 
            </p>
        </div> <br>

        <div> <!--Headings-->
            <h2>Headings</h2>
            <p>To make headings, you can use the h# element. There are different levels of headings from h1 which is the biggest to h6 which is the smallest. The heading you use signifies how important your heading is. <br> <br>
            Like this:<h5>This is the fifth heading</h5>
            </p>
        </div> <br>

        <div> <!--Strong-->
            <h2>Bolding</h2>
            <p>As for learning how to bold, there are 2 ways you can do so. The first is using  the b element. Like this: <b>I am bold</b>. Or you can use the strong element like this: <strong>I am strong</strong>. 
            </p> 

            <p>Either way, you will likely use the strong element more that the bold element. Another thing to note is that you will be use bold in between other elements like this: Hello, my name is <strong>Strong</strong>
            </p>
        </div> <br>

        <div> <!--Em-->
            <h2>Italicizing</h2>
            <p>Just like bolding, there are also two elements that can help make text italicize. The first way is by using the em element like this: <em>I am italicized!</em>. Or you can use the i element like this: <i>I am also italicized!</i> 
            </p>

            <p>Either way, just like the bolding method, you will be using these elements with text. For example: <em>Who</em> are you?</p>
        </div> <br>

        <div> <!--Underline-->
            <h2>Underlining</h2>
            <p>Lastly before you go, you might want to learn how to underline. Well, that is easy! You can simply use the u element to underline your text. <u>Like this!</u>
            </p>
        </div>

    </body>
</html>

<!-- Notes: 
    That is all for basic elements! Yes, I did kinda cheat by using the <div> element which stands for division. You won't learn about this later until we get to the nesting section!
