        <div>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Follow these instructions to make the cookies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Crush the freeze-dried strawberries into a powder using a food processor or any other method. But leave out 1 tablespoon for rolling later. 
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Mix the butter and sugar together with a mixer of your choice for 2 minutes into a bowl.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Stir the strawberry powder except for the reserved tablespoon to make the batter red. (You can also add food coloring if you are using it.)
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Crack the egg to add it to the batter and mix it until combined.
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                   In a separate bowl, add the flour and the strawberry powder. Mix them together until the bowl is red. Then add the dry bowl into the mixture in three equal parts. 
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Once all the ingredients are added together then add 1/4 cup of sugar into the mixture. Then, grab 1 and 1/2 tablespoon size of dough and roll them through the sugar bowl. 
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Place the dough balls 2 inches apart on a parchment lined sheet and bake for 11 minutes at 350ÂºF. 
                </li> <br>
                <li>
                    Once the cookies are done, let them cool on the sheet before putting them in a cooling place for a few minutes. Then, you are done! 
                </li> <br>

            </ol>
        </div> <br>

        <div>
            <h2>Some things to note:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Remember that each batch will differ depending on how many cookies you are planning to make.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Also, do not overbake the cookies because if you do then they will become dry and lose their strawberry taste. 
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Referring from the last point, you must let your baking sheet cool in between batches. Otherwise, you can have runny cookies which is not good. 
                </li> <br>
            </ul>

            <p>Otherwise, than that I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe as much as I did!</p>

    This new element allows the developer to make a footer on the page. It is the same thing as header but it was not required as of yet.
