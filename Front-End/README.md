# Front-End Folder

Welcome to my Front-End folder! Here you will find all of my work in different front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and JS. Each folder has a different sections of files designed to showcase my work in various areas. 

### College:

In this folder, it will have all of my work from different courses I took while studying at Florida State University. Each sub-folder will have documents and files pertaining to different front-end languages.  

### Project:

In this folder, it will consist of various projects to highlight and demonstrate everything I learned in college. Each sub-folder will have projects assign to them based on difficulty level.
