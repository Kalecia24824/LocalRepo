# Welcome to the Web Design sub-folder!
- By Kalecia McNeal 
In this folder, you can access all of my web design projects. Each project is categorized based on difficulty. There are 3 sub-folders called Beginner, Intermediate and Professional. Once in the sub-folders, you can see what projects I did with some notes provided at the end detailing my thoughts about each step. 

## Folder List with Descriptions:

### Beginner:
The Beginner folder contains all of my beginner designs. It will have things such as recipes, forms, email boxes. The Beginner folder is designed to demonstrate my ability in designing basic web ideas before the project. 

### Intermediate:
The Intermediate folder will contain files for my intermediate web projects. In it, there will be sub-folders for the web dev projects since they will have more than one web page. Thus, this folder will serve as my introduction into web design techniques.  

### Professional: 
Lastly, the Professional folder will be similar to the Intermediate folder except it will have dynamic design. This folder will consist of website prototypes in my style as it is the final versions of my projects.
