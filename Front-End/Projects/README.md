# The Projects Folder
- By Kalecia McNeal 

This folder contains all of my projects in web development and design. In each sub-folder will have files that are sorted into folders based on difficulty. The Projects folder is designed to serve as a final portfolio to showcase the skills and learning I received while in my college classes at Florida State University! 

## Folder List with Descriptions:

### Web Dev:
[Web Dev README](Web-App/README.md "My Web Dev Folder")

This folder will hold all of my final projects for web development programming. In the Web Dev folder, there will be 3 sub-folders called Beginner, Intermediate and Professional. Each folder will have a README where you can learn more about the projects. 

### Web Design:
[Web Design README](Web-Design/README.md "My Web Design Folder")
In the Web Design folder, there will 3 folders just like the Web Dev folder. However, they consist of different website designs from basic forms to more advanced. You can click on the README to learn more about each sub-folder.
