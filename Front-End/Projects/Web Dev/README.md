# Welcome to the Web Design sub-folder!
- By Kalecia McNeal 
In this folder, you can access all of my web development projects. There are 3 sub-folders called Beginner, Intermediate and Professional. Once in the sub-folders, you can see what projects I did with some notes provided at the end detailing my thoughts about each step. 

## Folder List with Descriptions:

### Beginner:
The Beginner folder contains all of my beginner projects. This can be things such as forms to product pages. It will have just the basics of HTML, CSS and JS

### Intermediate:
Th Intermediate folder contains all of my intermediate projects which can range from a basic website to more interactive pages. Each project will use more intermediate HTML, CSS and JS along with basic into into jQuery. 

### Professional: 
Finally, the Professional folder will have all of my advanced projects which includes dynamic pages to hosting websites. Like the other folders, the Professional folder contains languages in HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery. But PHP and MySQL will be used here as well.
