      <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
         It is very simliar to all Florida weather which is cold in 
         the morning and hot in the afternoon during spring, fall and
         winter. But in the summer, it is blazing hot all day since we 
         are the closer to the equator.

      <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>
         I am not sure. The last time I checked it was somewhere 
         between 500,000 and 900,000. But it does not matter either 
         way because it is a ghost town.

        <p>
         If you are looking for sports here, I hate to disappoint you
         but I do not know! I don't like sports anyway!
