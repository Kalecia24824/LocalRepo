      <h1>HTML Text Basics</h1>
      <p>This is a HTML reference sheet you can use for text.</p>
    </header> <br>

    <div>
      <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
      <p>To make a paragraph, you can use the p element.</p>
    </div> <br> 

    <div>
      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>
        To make headings you can use these elements: <br> 
        <h1>First</h1>
        <h2>Second</h2>
        <h3>Third</h3>
        <h4>Fourth</h4>
        <h5>Fifth</h5>
        <h6>Sixth</h6> <br> 
        All of these headings will vary depending on which way you use them!
      </p>
    </div> <br> 

    <div>
      <h2>Bold Text</h2>
      <p>
        To make text bold, you can use two ways. The first is using the strong element <strong>like so.</strong> 
        Or you can use the <b>b</b> element like this as well.
      </p>
    </div> <br> 

    <div>
      <h2>Italicized</h2>
      <p>
        To make italicized text, you can also you two elements called the <em>em</em> or the <i>i</i>. 
      </p>
    </div> <br> 

    <div>
      <h2>Underline</h2>
      <p>
        To underline text, you can use the <u>u element.</u>
      </p>
    </div> <br> 

    <div>
      <h2>HTML comments</h2>
      <p>
        To make HTML comments you can use the <!----> but you would have to see it in the HTML file!
      </p>
    </div> 

    <div>
      <p>And that is all! I hope this basic guide helps!</p>
    </div>
  </body>

<!--
    Note: This is a reference sheet I can use for later in case I forget any elements. Now, I did cheat a little by using header and div elements but in this case they are used for spacing purposes.
